# Timer
Welcome to my first project using JS!

This project is based on the program I've been following on Rocketseat, a great Brazilian educational plataform dedicated to technology teaching.

[Original](https://www.figma.com/file/Pw8yMsK7HFkD6aISZt6gPA/Stage-05---Focus-Timer-2.0/duplicate?node-id=0%3A1) project layout.

Being a challenge to train us students, I decided to add some functions, such as:

- Mobile version with vibration;
- Set time button;
- Clickable arrows to select the amount of time you need.

The original had the cons like:

- Prompts appeared for you to set the time;
- If you set it wrong, you had to either reset or use "+" and "-".
